circular petrol pump
implement circular queue using modulus
    but dont use in interview as % is heavy operator
input restricted queue
    push only from rear but pop from both front and rear
output restricted queue
    pop only from front but push from both front and rear
find front, back, empty, size in CQueue and CDeque
read deque documentation from cpp reference
STL deque has no concept of circular
how STL deque is implemented
    doubly linked list i guess?

enqueue
    push / add in front
dequeue
    pop / remove from rear

deque
    doubly ended queue
    push and pop from both front and rear
    can either be circular or not
